# MyReads: A Book Tracking App
This is the project developed as the final assessment project for Udacity's React course. MyReads is a
bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books we have read, are currently reading,or want to read.


# App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets us select the shelf for that book. When we select a different shelf, the book moves there.
The main page also has a link to `/search`, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library. We can navigate to the search page from the icon that appears on the bottom right of the main page.
